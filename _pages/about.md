I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at Texas Tech University, working in the Computational Intelligence, Control, and Information Lab (CI²) under the supervision of [Dr. Stas Tiomkin](https://www.depts.ttu.edu/cs/faculty/Stas_tiomkin/stastiomkin.php).

I'm interested in studying hybrid dynamical systems where continuous evolution interacts with discrete events such as contact. I am especially interested in combining classical sensitivity analysis with information-theoretic approaches—such as empowerment and intrinsic motivation—to develop new training principles for robots operating in contact-rich and uncertain environments. This perspective bridges control theory and machine learning, aiming to uncover mechanisms that enable robust, adaptive, and intelligent behavior.

I am also interested in generative AI, including GANs and other generative models. I’m exploring how these approaches can model complex data distributions and uncertainty, which could eventually inform how we simulate, predict, or train intelligent systems in more flexible and creative ways.
